<p>That weekend before Christmas, while the kids and I were attending my friend Louie Holliday’s birthday party I introduced Elijah to Karaoke. A Karaoke machine had been setup at the front of the sanctuary inside the church where the party was being held. It wasn’t being used, so I brought Elijah over to it to show him how it worked, handed him a microphone, and encouraged him to try singing.</p>
<p>Elijah has an interest in singing, but still I thought maybe he would sing a few Christmas songs before he lost interest. To my surprise, once he got used to the microphone he sang a lot longer--and many of the songs he made up himself. At one point, his older sister Kayla joined in.</p>
