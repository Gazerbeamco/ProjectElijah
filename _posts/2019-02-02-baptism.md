<i>March 17, 2013 in Mount Pleasant Community Church</i>

Elijah was baptised today during the 11 a.m. service at the Mount Pleasant Community Church. There was only one other child, a young girl around four or five years old, being baptised so Elijah didnâ€™t have to wait long before it was his turn. Elijah was asleep during the opening songs for the service, but woke up when Pastor Brian splashed the water on his head.

Family members present were my in-laws Terry and Nancy, Susan and Alan, and my nieces and nephew Alex, Allyson, and Mea. Our long time friends and nieghbors the Hollidays were also in attendance.

After the church service, we all met at Pizza Hut for lunch.
